# üß© Tolt Flow Conditions Task

Welcome to the **Tolt Engineering Challenge**.

This task is designed to evaluate your ability to work with **React (Next.js)**, **TypeScript**, and **UI state management** using **shadcn/ui**.  
You‚Äôll be working on a simplified version of the **Flow Conditions** modal used in Tolt‚Äôs production app.

---

## üéØ Goal

You are given a working version of the **‚ÄúAdd Additional Conditions‚Äù** modal.  
Your task is to **extend the existing logic** so that conditions can be grouped and nested using **AND / OR** operators.

In production, this feature determines whether a commission should be generated based on certain criteria (like partner, product, billing type, etc.).

---

## üì¶ What‚Äôs already included

The project includes:

- ‚úÖ **Functional base modal** built with `shadcn/ui`
- ‚úÖ Flat conditions logic (all AND or all OR)
- ‚úÖ A working ‚ÄúTest Flow‚Äù button that evaluates mock data against the entered conditions
- ‚úÖ UI components for adding, removing, and clearing conditions
- ‚úÖ Predefined condition options:
  - `partner_id`
  - `product_id`
  - `interval`
  - `billing_type`

Your starting UI should look like this:

## üß† Your task

You need to **implement nested condition groups**, allowing structures like:

```text
(Partner ID equals "p_123")
AND
(
  (Billing Type equals "recurring")
  OR
  (Interval equals "monthly")
)
```

## üìù Instructions

1. Fork this repository
2. Implement the nested condition groups
3. Run the project and test the functionality
4. Submit a pull request

## üìù Notes

The flow object looks like this:
