# üß© Tolt Flow Conditions Task

Welcome to the **Tolt Engineering Challenge**.

This task is designed to evaluate your ability to work with **React (Next.js)**, **TypeScript**, and **UI state management** using **shadcn/ui**.  
You‚Äôll be working on a simplified version of the **Flow Conditions** modal used in Tolt‚Äôs production app.

---

## üéØ Goal

You are given a working version of the **‚ÄúAdd Additional Conditions‚Äù** modal.  
Your task is to **extend the existing logic** so that conditions can be grouped and nested using **AND / OR** operators.

In production, this feature determines whether a commission should be generated based on certain criteria (like partner, product, billing type, etc.).

---

## üì¶ What‚Äôs already included

The project includes:

- ‚úÖ **Functional base modal** built with `shadcn/ui`
- ‚úÖ Flat conditions logic (all AND or all OR)
- ‚úÖ A working ‚ÄúTest Flow‚Äù button that evaluates mock data against the entered conditions
- ‚úÖ UI components for adding, removing, and clearing conditions
- ‚úÖ Predefined condition options:
  - `partner_id`
  - `product_id`
  - `interval`
  - `billing_type`

Your starting UI should look like this:

---

## üß† Your task

You need to **implement nested condition groups**, allowing structures like:

```text
(Partner ID equals "p_123")
AND
(
  (Billing Type equals "recurring")
  OR
  (Interval equals "monthly")
)
```

## üìù Notes

The flow object looks like this:

```json

    "id": "flw_UvLodqUdCF8Y1KuSZuiW9mCY",
    "name": "$5 Flow",
    "description": "Earn $5 for every referral.",

                ],

        },
        "group_name": "Default"
    },
```

## Current Problem

There is a user that wants to give a $10 commission for every tranasction where the partner is in XYZ countries and the product ID is either X or Y.

```text
Partner Country is in ["AF", "AX", "AL", "DZ", "AS", "AD", "AO"]
AND
(
  Product ID is X
  OR
  Product ID is Y
)
```

## When you are done

1. Push changes to your repository or submit a pull request.
2. Send the link to the repository or PR if possible send the link to the live demo.
3. Record a video explaining your solution and how it works and answer the following questions:
   - This data is coming from the database, does the solution require changes to the database schema?
     - A. If so, how would you change the schema?
     - B. What will happen to the existing flows, will they still work with your code?
     - C. Will we need to update all existing flows, or do you have a different approach for it?
   - Would you do it differently if you had to do it again - design wise, code wise, etc...?
  

## Desig
- If the design is not great and you can do better, then feel free to do it :)
